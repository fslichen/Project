	<h1>Spring Component Scan</h1>
	<p>
		Although the component scan is not required in this case due to the fact that you don't
		need to put @Service annotation inside AnyEntity1. I want to point out that @Service and 
		@Component are basically the same. But keep in mind that the applicationContext-mongo.xml
		is actually scanning the packages, therefore if you forget to put @Document inside AnyEntity1,
		you will encounter an exception.
